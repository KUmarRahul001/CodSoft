# Movie Rating Prediction with Python

This repository contains the implementation of a movie rating prediction system using Python. The project was completed as part of the internship program at Codsoft during the Feb - March batch.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of accurately predicting movie ratings based on various features. The project involved:

- Exploring and understanding the dataset
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementing machine learning algorithms
- Model training and evaluation
- Fine-tuning the model for better performance

## Features

- **Python Implementation:** The project is entirely implemented in Python, making use of popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Various machine learning algorithms were explored, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Different evaluation metrics were used to assess the performance of the predictive models, including mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score.
- **Collaboration:** The project encouraged collaboration among interns, fostering teamwork, knowledge sharing, and skill development.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/movie-rating-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd movie-rating-prediction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the main script to train and evaluate the predictive model:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
