# Task1: Titanic Prediction Model

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew.

The goal of this task is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a passenger would have survived based on attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, and others.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the famous Titanic dataset, which is available in CSV format. It contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, cabin number, port of embarkation, and whether they survived or not.

# Implementation
The implementation is divided into the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing features to improve model performance.

3. Model Selection: Selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms for training the prediction model.

4. Model Training: Training the selected model using the preprocessed dataset.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance.

6. Prediction: Making predictions on new data to determine the survival probability of passengers.

# Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/KumarRahulProgrammer/CodSoft.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the implementation.

# Results
The performance of the prediction model can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations can be generated to analyze the importance of different features in predicting survival.
