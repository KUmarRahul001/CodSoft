# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for Iris Flower Classification using Python. The dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species of Iris flowers. The objective is to train a model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the file `irisdataset.csv`. It contains 150 instances of Iris flowers with their respective measurements and species labels.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `irisdataset.csv`: Dataset file containing the measurements and species labels of Iris flowers.
- `iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the entire project.
- `iris_classification_model.pkl`: Serialized model file saved after model training for deployment.

## Dependencies
To run the project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python (>=3.6)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- joblib

You can install the dependencies using pip:

''' pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib joblib ''' 


## Instructions
1. Clone the repository:

'''git clone https://github.com/KUmarRahul001/CodSoft/edit/main/TASK3.git

'''

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd iris-flower-classification

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `iris_classification.ipynb` to execute the code and train the model.
4. After training, the serialized model will be saved as `iris_classification_model.pkl`.
5. You can deploy the model for real-world predictions or further analysis.
